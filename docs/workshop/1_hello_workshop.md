This is the beginning of our journey. Our goal is simple but not always easy: can we
get our developer environment setup?

[![Dev Environments](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)](https://xkcd.com/1987/)

## **Get Ready**: System-level installation

![Take This](1_images/0_take_this.png)

You'll need the following software installed to begin:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

!!! note "Optional software"
    === "Python managers"
        To keep Python from messing up your OS configs, It is recommended to install &
        manage Python interpreters using a manager like
        [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) or
        [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/). This will allow you to add/remove specific
        and multiple Python environments on your system. Testing your code against multiple
        versions of Python is a necessity for professional projects!
    === "Poetry"
        [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is an alternative to `pip`.
        Those who prefer `pip` or other Python environment tools are welcome to use the
        `requirements-dev.txt` file in the **requirements** directory of this repo.
        <br/>**Why Poetry?**<br/>
        While hatch and other tools are promising, as of this workshop Poetry remains one
        of the best developer experiences (DX) for setup of python virtual environments and
        [PEP 518 and 621 pyproject.toml based Python packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#pyproject-toml-spec).

## **Get Set**: Prepare your virtual environment

### Install the `avengercon` package and dependencies

1. Establish a virtual environment with `poetry shell` or [use pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments)
2. Install `avengercon` & dependencies with `poetry install` or [use pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-a-requirements-file)
3. Confirm that the local `avengercon` package is available in your virtual environment

```bash
(avengercon-py3.11) $ python -m avengercon
Hello, Workshop!
```

### Configure your IDE to use the virtual environment
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments),
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html), and
most other popular Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) support intellisense and
other productivity boosters when properly configured to use the project's virtual
environment.

### Generate your `.env` file
Using a terminal from the top level `avengercon_2024` directory, run the
`initialize_env.sh` script to dynamically generate configuration metadata in a `.env`
file.

=== "Windows"
    ``` cmd
    bash scripts\initialize_env.sh
    ```

=== "Unix (Mac/Linux)"
    ``` bash
    chmox +x scripts/initialize_env.sh
    ./scripts/initialize_env.sh
    ```

You should now see a `.env` file in your `avengercon_2024` directory that looks
something like this:
``` toml title=".env"
# Used by run_*.sh scripts & avengercon module to dynamically configure localhost
# development and testing environment variable coordination.
# Valid log level values: 'critical', 'error', 'warning', 'info', 'debug'
LOG_LEVEL=info
# Traefik settings and labels
HTTP_PORT=57073
DOMAIN=localhost
...
```

## ðŸš€ **Launch!**
Using a terminal from the top level `avengercon_2024` directory, launch the `docker
compose` deployment using the `run_dev.sh` script.

=== "Windows"
    ``` cmd
    bash run_dev.sh
    ```

=== "Unix (Mac/Linux)"
    ``` bash
    chmox +x run_dev.sh
    run_dev.sh
    ```

!!! warning "Keep your containers deployed"
    Don't close the terminal running your deployment! We'll be using the logs that
    appear to help monitor the state of our workshop's services and code.

!!! note "Port conflicts"
    If you're already running a Traefik reverse proxy or services that use the ports
    listed in the `.env`, you will need to adjust the ports being used for this workshop.

If everything is going well, you should not see any "ERR" or "ERROR" in the logs that
appear in your terminal.
